The codes are mostly related to Mechanical Engineering and Fluid Dynamics.\r\n\r\n## SimpleMAC\r\nA Marker and cell method solver for the incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations. Uses an unstructured finite difference scheme with the ability to solve for scalars, complex geometry, and massless particles. This is considered to be a research grade code with no interface for users with a very good understanding of CFD and Fortran 90.\r\n\r\n[SimpleMAC Source](https://github.com/jonkomperda/SimpleMAC)\r\n\r\n## PySimpleMAC\r\nPySimpleMAC is a Python module which uses the carrier phase solver from SimpleMAC. It provides a user interface, a benchmark problem, and a load of documentation that is rather easy to understand. Scripting using PySimpleMAC is much simpler than using SimpleMAC, it's as easy as importing a module and using the built in functions as a 'black box', or you can just use the pre-built example GUI and work from there.\r\n\r\n[PySimpleMAC Page](http://jonkomperda.github.com/PySimpleMAC/)\r\n"}
